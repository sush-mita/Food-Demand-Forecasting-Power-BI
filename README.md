Food Demand Forecasting using Power BI

I have taken the data set of food demand forecasting from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kannanaikkal/food-demand-forecasting

In My Power BI report I have used the food delivery logo of Zomato and this is just to make my reposrt presentable but the data doesnt belng to Zomato Company.

I tired answering all the questions based on the problem statement in my report.
